DroidScript Gameview - Virus Defence Game

Whilst we've all been stuck in isolation, I've been feeling a bit bored and helpless, 
so I thought it's time to get some payback on the Virus...

I have been playing with the DroidScript Gameview 
and have created a light hearted (and topical) game to keep us all entertained.
 
You can check it out here:

The game runs in browser, on PC and Mobile (Android and iOS) and can be downloaded to desktop as it is a PWA 
(Menu then either "add to homescreen" or "Install Viral Defence Game" in Chrome).
This may be useful for anyone wanting to build their own PWA games.
